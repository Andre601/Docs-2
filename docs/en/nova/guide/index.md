# Getting started
This chapter will guide you through the basics of Nova. We will cover your first energy source and basic machines you'll want to use from that point on. The recipes should be looked up in game either with `/nvrecipe nova:<itemname>`, `/nova items`, or the crafting book inside the workbench GUI.


## Basics
Nova machines are based off of different tiers: basic, advanced, elite, and ultimate. For cables and power cells, they control the internal storage and the transfer speeds. Machines are classed into the different tiers so that high-end machines require more effort to craft.


## Energy
### Furnace Generator
Your machines will require energy to use, so start by getting a Furnace Generator. The Furnace Generator is the easiest power source to obtain and will burn any item, like a normal furnace would, for energy.


### Cables
To connect your energy source to your machines, you'll need some cables. The first cables one should craft are the basic cables. All cables can transport energy, fluids and items. They come in different tiers, from basic to ultimate. Better cables give higher transfer rates.


### Power Cell
In order to store the energy you generate, you should craft a Power Cell. The basic one will store 100,000,000J. This will also come in handy when you have solar panels as an energy source because they won't generate energy during the night.

## Machines
### Mechanical Press
Now that you've gotten energy, you'll want to put it to use. We'll start by crafting the Mechanical Press. This machine is the basis for all other machine because it crafts gears and plates, both of which you'll need to craft other machines in the future.


### Electrical Furnace
The Electrical Furnace will smelt items twice as fast as a normal furnace, but will use more energy. This means that you would need to feed more coal into the furnace generator, to generate the energy needed to smelt something in the Electric Furnace, than you would need to use in a normal furnace. 


### Pulverizer
The Pulverizer pulverizes ores and metals into dust. Its main usage is ore duplication, but it can also be used to "uncraft" plates and gears.


## Advanced Energy
### Solar Panels
Solar energy gives you the ability to generate energy without needing to constantly expend resources like coal for it, but it depends on sunlight.


## Finished
This covers the basics of Nova, and from here you can advance to whatever machine you want. Personally, I like to continue with bigger energy storage, so my machines can run throughout the night.
